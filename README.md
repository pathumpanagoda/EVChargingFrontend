## Role-Based Access Control

### Backoffice Role
- Full access to all features
- Can create/edit/delete users
- Can create/edit/delete stations
- Can manage EV owners (create, edit, deactivate, reactivate)
- Can approve bookings

### StationOperator Role
- Read-only access to users
- Can edit station details and schedules
- Can view and approve bookings
- Cannot perform system admin actions

## API Integration

The frontend integrates with the following backend endpoints:

- **Authentication**: `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`
- **Users**: `/api/user` (CRUD operations)
- **EV Owners**: `/api/evowner` (CRUD operations)
- **Stations**: `/api/station` (CRUD operations, scheduling)
- **Bookings**: `/api/booking` (CRUD operations, approval)

## Key Features

### Dashboard
- Role-based statistics and quick actions
- Recent bookings overview
- System status indicators

### User Management (Backoffice only)
- Create system users with roles
- Edit user details and roles
- Deactivate users

### EV Owner Management
- Create and manage EV owner accounts
- Search and filter owners
- Deactivate/reactivate accounts (Backoffice only)

### Station Management
- Create charging stations with location data
- Manage daily schedules
- Deactivate stations (with conflict checking)

### Booking Management
- Create bookings with 7-day window limit
- 12-hour modification rule enforcement
- Status-based filtering and actions
- Role-based approval workflow

## Form Validation

All forms use Zod schemas for validation:

- **User Form**: Username (3-50 chars), role selection, password (6+ chars)
- **Owner Form**: NIC (10-12 chars), name, email, phone, password
- **Station Form**: Name, type (AC/DC), slots (1-50), coordinates, address
- **Booking Form**: Station selection, future datetime, 7-day limit

## Error Handling

- Global error handling with Axios interceptors
- 401 errors automatically redirect to login
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Form validation with inline error messages

## Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- Responsive grid layouts
- Collapsible sidebar on mobile
- Touch-friendly interface elements

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Code Style

- ESLint configuration for React and JavaScript
- Consistent component structure
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- TypeScript-style prop validation with PropTypes

## Deployment

1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `dist` folder to your web server
3. Ensure the backend API is accessible from the frontend domain
4. Update the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable for production

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Connection Issues**: Verify the backend is running and `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is correct
2. **Authentication Issues**: Check if JWT token is being stored and sent correctly
3. **CORS Issues**: Ensure the backend allows requests from the frontend domain
4. **Build Issues**: Clear node_modules and reinstall dependencies

### Browser Support

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Contributing

1. Follow the existing code structure and patterns
2. Use meaningful component and variable names
3. Add proper error handling and loading states
4. Test on multiple screen sizes
5. Follow the established ESLint rules
